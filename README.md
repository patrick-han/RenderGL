# RenderGL
My first OpenGL rendering engine!

This is a simple rendering engine written in C++ with OpenGL. Based mostly on this fantastic book: [https://learnopengl.com/](https://learnopengl.com/)

Some of the details differ in implementation, since I also wanted to use this as an exercise in design. At the moment the header files included the class implementations, just for the sake of simplicity while learning.
